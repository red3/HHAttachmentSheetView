## Installation

### CocoaPods

```ruby
pod "HHAttachmentSheetView"
``` 
### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager for Cocoa application. To install the carthage tool, you can use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh).

``` bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate HHAttachmentSheetView into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

``` ogdl
github "red3/HHAttachmentSheetView" ~> 1.1.0
```

Then, run the following command to build the HHAttachmentSheetView framework:

``` bash
$ carthage update

```

At last, you need to set up your Xcode project manually to add the HHAttachmentSheetView framework.

On your application targets‚Äô ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù settings tab, in the ‚ÄúLinked Frameworks and Libraries‚Äù section, drag and drop each framework you want to use from the Carthage/Build folder on disk.

On your application targets‚Äô ‚ÄúBuild Phases‚Äù settings tab, click the ‚Äú+‚Äù icon and choose ‚ÄúNew Run Script Phase‚Äù. Create a Run Script with the following content:

``` 
/usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks
```

and add the paths to the frameworks you want to use under ‚ÄúInput Files‚Äù:

``` 
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/HHAttachmentSheet.framework
```

For more information about how to use Carthage, please see its [project page](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage).
